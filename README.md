# Alaya

A neuroscience and Buddhist psychology-inspired memory engine for conversational AI agents.

**Alaya** (Sanskrit: *alaya-vijnana*, "storehouse consciousness") is a Rust
library that provides three-tier memory, a Hebbian graph overlay, hybrid
retrieval with spreading activation, and adaptive lifecycle processes. It is
headless and LLM-agnostic — the consuming agent owns identity, embeddings,
and prompt assembly.

## Why Alaya?

Most AI memory systems are Python libraries that require external infrastructure
(Postgres, Neo4j, Redis, Pinecone) and are tightly coupled to specific LLM
providers. Alaya takes a different approach.

**Key differentiators:**

- **Single-file deployment** — one SQLite database, no external services
- **Rust** — embed in any language via FFI, or use natively with zero GC pauses
- **LLM-agnostic** — no hardcoded provider; the agent supplies embeddings and consolidation logic via traits
- **No network calls** — fully local, privacy by architecture
- **Memory as process** — Hebbian graph reshaping, adaptive forgetting, and preference crystallization make memory a living system, not a static store
- **Principled foundations** — architecture grounded in CLS theory, Bjork forgetting, spreading activation, and Yogacara psychology, not ad-hoc heuristics

### Three Stores

| Store | Analog | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Episodic** | Hippocampus | Raw conversation events with full context |
| **Semantic** | Neocortex | Distilled knowledge extracted through consolidation |
| **Implicit** | Alaya-vijnana | Preferences and habits that emerge through perfuming |

### Graph Overlay

A Hebbian weighted directed graph spans all three stores. Links strengthen on
co-retrieval (LTP) and weaken through disuse (LTD), naturally developing
small-world topology.

### Retrieval Pipeline

```

### Lifecycle Processes

| Process | Inspiration | What it does |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Consolidation** | CLS theory (McClelland et al.) | Distills episodes into semantic knowledge |
| **Perfuming** | Vasana (Yogacara Buddhist psychology) | Accumulates impressions, crystallizes preferences |
| **Transformation** | Asraya-paravrtti | Deduplicates, resolves contradictions, prunes |
| **Forgetting** | Bjork & Bjork (1992) | Decays retrieval strength, archives weak nodes |

## Quick Start

```rust
use alaya::{AlayaStore, NewEpisode, Role, EpisodeContext, Query, NoOpProvider};

// Open a persistent database
let store = AlayaStore::open("memory.db")?;

// Store a conversation episode
store.store_episode(&NewEpisode {
    content: "I've been learning Rust for about six months now".into(),
    role: Role::User,
    session_id: "session-1".into(),
    timestamp: 1740000000,
    context: EpisodeContext::default(),
    embedding: None, // pass Some(vec![...]) if you have embeddings
})?;

// Query with hybrid retrieval
let results = store.query(&Query::simple("Rust experience"))?;
for mem in &results {
    println!("[{:.2}] {}", mem.score, mem.content);
}

// Get crystallized preferences
let prefs = store.preferences(Some("communication_style"))?;

// Run lifecycle with a no-op provider (or implement ConsolidationProvider)
let noop = NoOpProvider;
store.consolidate(&noop)?;
store.transform()?;
store.forget()?;
```

## Research Foundations

### Neuroscience

- **Hebbian LTP/LTD** — synapses strengthen on co-activation (Hebb 1949, Bliss & Lomo 1973)
- **Complementary Learning Systems** — fast hippocampus + slow neocortex (McClelland et al. 1995)
- **Spreading Activation** — associative retrieval beyond embedding similarity (Collins & Loftus 1975)
- **Encoding Specificity** — context-dependent retrieval (Tulving & Thomson 1973)
- **Dual-Strength Forgetting** — storage vs retrieval strength (Bjork & Bjork 1992)
- **Retrieval-Induced Forgetting** — retrieving some memories suppresses competitors (Anderson et al. 1994)
- **Working Memory Limits** — 4 +/- 1 chunks (Cowan 2001)

### Yogacara Buddhist psychology

- **Alaya-vijnana** — the storehouse consciousness, persistent substrate for all seeds
- **Bija (seeds)** — living potentials that ripen when conditions align
- **Vasana (perfuming)** — gradual accumulation of impressions that shape behavior
- **Asraya-paravrtti** — periodic transformation toward clarity
- **Vijnaptimatrata** — memory is perspective-relative, not objective

### Information Retrieval

- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion** — merging multiple ranked result sets (Cormack et al. 2009)
- **BM25 via FTS5** — keyword matching with relevance scoring
- **Cosine Similarity** — semantic vector search

## Design Principles

1. **Memory is a process, not a database.** Every retrieval changes what is
   remembered. The graph reshapes through use.

2. **Forgetting is a feature.** Strategic decay and suppression improve
   retrieval quality over time.

3. **Preferences emerge, they are not declared.** The vasana/perfuming model
   lets behavioral patterns crystallize from accumulated observations.

4. **The agent owns identity.** Alaya stores seeds. The agent decides which
   seeds matter and how to present them.

5. **Graceful degradation.** No embeddings? BM25-only. No LLM for
   consolidation? Episodes accumulate. Every feature works independently.
